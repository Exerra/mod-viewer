## Development

You will be running two processes during development using one command:

- The Miniflare server (miniflare is a local environment for Cloudflare Workers)
- The Remix development server

```sh
# concurrently starts both the remix server and miniflare
$ npm run dev
```

Open up [http://127.0.0.1:8787](http://127.0.0.1:8787) and you should be ready to go!
